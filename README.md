Addon to play "You got mail" when you receive mail.

When you get a new mail, you will be notified with the nostalgic AOL "You Got Mail" sound.

New options allow you to set the voice to a fan interpretation of in-game voices.

Access the options from the Addon Options Interface, or /ygm to go directly there.

Note: The announcement is made when a user logs on or reloads.
Additional announcements will be made only once per hour to prevent notification spam.
