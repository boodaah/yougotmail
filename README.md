Simple addon to play "You got mail" when you receive mail.

When you get a new mail, you will be notified with the nostalgic AOL "You Got Mail" sound.

No options to set, will only remind you once per hour so you don't get flooded with notifications.

Note:
The announcement is made when a user logs on or reloads.
Additional announcements will be made once per hour when
a player does anything that creates a load screen, such as
going thru a portal, or entering or leaving an instance.
